This is a personal helper program that helps me generate pages of my website alexanderwen.me
It takes the contents of a template file and locates the lines {{ body }} and {{ menu }}.
From another file, it replaces {{ body }} in the template to the intended body, and it
  auto-generates the menu based on the different given sections.
